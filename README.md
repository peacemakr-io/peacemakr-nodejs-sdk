### Why Peacemakr
We know what it's like to have your PM come to you late on a Friday and ask you for something
complicated. That's why we want to make it simple - to let you go home on that Friday night.
You can start encrypting messages in half an hour and get home in time for dinner.

This is all you need to get started, along with an API key. Visit [admin.peacemakr.io](https://admin.peacemakr.io) to get one of those.
