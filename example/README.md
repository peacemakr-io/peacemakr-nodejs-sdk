This a simple demo of Peacemakr's NodeJS SDK

An API Key is required to run an example app:
- provide your Peacemakr's API key directly in example/src/example.ts or
- via .env file (preferred) in the root of the sdk project
```$xslt
echo "PEACEMAKR_APIKEY=<YOUR_KEY>" > ../.env
```

To run app locally please:
```$xslt
npm run run-example
```
